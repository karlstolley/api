        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          This project asks you to build a small program in JavaScript that runs in the browser. It
          will operate on a small piece of JSON data that you will provide. The program should
          manipulate that data in some way, and present it in the browser.

        <p>
          You will develop an application in Node.js that pulls in external data from at least one
          third-party API. There is an option as to what kind of application you will build: either
          a command-line application (e.g., for storing API data for further analysis in another
          piece of software) or a Web application (e.g., for creating an interface that displays a
          mashup of data coming from different APIs).
